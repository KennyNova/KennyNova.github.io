            My name is Navid Madani. I am currently a CS student at Georgia State University. I've have always enjoyed learning
           about new technologies and implementing them into my day to day life. I aspire to become a Full Stack developer as I love
           working in both the frontend and backend. I am working everyday to achieve this goal by learning as much as I can and then
           using that knowledge to create apps.
